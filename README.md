# P O L O N E Z – A U T O D R I V E

**Created by:** Maciej Skorus

A synthwave-styled Three.js "coloring book"-like animation. A built-in GUI allows the user to experiment with scene models and colors.

All models were created in 3Ds Max 2018, updated in 3Ds Max 2023, and exported as `.fbx` files (some include animations).

**Press ENTER** to activate steering with the left and right arrow keys.  
**Press ESC** to exit.
